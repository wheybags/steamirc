steamirc
========

Fake irc server that relays pms and channel messages to and from steam pms and steam group chats

code is kinda messy atm, will clean it up once i get around to it.
Used vs because of c# and because that's what the steamre devs used.
my code is in projects/steamirc. The rest is from the steamirc mercurial.

username and pass go in the Steam.cs file (for now).
